- This readme file can function as our current TODO list and a place for sharing info
- We'll want to look into https://readthedocs.org/ for documenting the library
- Let's make sure to loop in Josh B as soon as possible
- We should also look into continous integration; this look's especially promising: https://travis-ci.org/
- And for much later, more on Apache Spark here: https://spark.apache.org/
